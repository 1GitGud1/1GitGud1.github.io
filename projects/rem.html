        <p>REM (Real Estate Manager) is a desktop application I developed for RBA Investment FZ to streamline property and facility management operations.
        The system centralizes key tasks such as managing tenant contracts, recording payments, scheduling services, and tracking preventive maintenance activities.
        Its primary goal is to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and provide a reliable platform for day-to-day building management.
        It was built using the .NET framework, with the front-end developed in Windows Forms, and the database implemented with Entity Framework Core and SQL Server.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This was my first professional project as a software developer, so I was determined to approach the development process properly. Since our team was small, we followed an Agile methodology for speed and flexibility. 
        After years of working on personal projects, it was exciting to finally experience a structured development cycle.
        
        I spent the first few days researching and testing different UI frameworks, and eventually settled on Windows Forms. Although itâ€™s dated and lacks the capabilities of modern frameworks, 
        it was the right choice for building an internal company tool, where functionality and speed of delivery mattered more than visual style.

        For the database, I worked with Entity Framework Core. It was a new technology for me, but I was eager to learn it because of the convenience it offers for data management and migrations. 
        The learning curve was worth it, and I came out of the project much more confident in handling real-world database challenges.                                                                                
        
        Delivering the finished product was a huge milestone. It validated my ability to take a project from design to deployment, lead a small team, and adapt to new technologies. 
        Following this project, I was offered a full-time position as a System Engineer.

            After confering with the clients and coming up with the functional requirements, we started planning out the sprints and most importantly, the technologies we would use.
